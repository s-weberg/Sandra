    <h1>Sandra's diary</h1>
    
    <div>
        <h3>Who am I?</h3>
        <p>My name is Sandra and I am 34 years old. I live in
            Helsingborg with my three pets. Two dogs named Doris and Disa and a
            hamster named Elvis. Some people laugh when I tell them I have a hamster, haha. 
            But I just love animals and he's so cute so I couldn't resist bringing him home. <br><br>
            
            I'm really excited about this course and hope I will learn a lot of 
            new things about coding. My english has not been active for a while, 
            but hopefully I will learn more of the language during this course. <br><br>
        
            I've learned some HTML before but my memory is very blurry so I don't remember 
            much about it, more than I thought it was fun.
        </p>
            <p>
            <h3>My top 5 things to do is when I'm not learning how to code:</h3> 
            <ol>
                <li>Hang out with my family and friends</li>
                <li>Cuddle and train my dogs</li>
                <li>Play fortnite (and other games). Extra fun when I play with my siblings.</li>
                <li>Sun holidays</li>
                <li>Reading books. Especially on the beach.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <p>Some of the exercies I do with my dogs are NoseWork, tracking and just some 
            circus activities.
        </p>

        <p>Looking forward to next week so I can learn more!</p>
