    <h1>Sandra's diary</h1>
    
    <div class="box">
        <h3>Who am I?</h3>
        <p> My name is Sandra and I am 34 years old. I live in Helsingborg with my 
            three pets. Two dogs named Doris and Disa and a hamster named Elvis. 
            Some people laugh when I tell them I have a hamster. But I just love animals 
            and he's so cute so I couldn't resist bringing him home.</p>

        <p> I'm really excited about this course and hope I will learn a 
            lot of new things about coding. My english has not been active 
            for a while, but hopefully I will learn more of the language during this course.</p>
   
        <p> I've learned some HTML before but my memory is very blurry so I don't remember 
            much about it, more than I thought it was fun.</p>
            
        <h3>My top 5 things to do is when I'm not learning how to code:</h3>
        
            <ol>
                <li>Hang out with my family and friends</li>
                <li>Cuddle and train my dogs</li>
                <li>Play fortnite (and other games). Extra fun when I play with my siblings.</li>
                <li>Sun holidays</li>
                <li>Reading books. Especially on the beach.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
            
        <p> Some of the exercies I do with my dogs are NoseWork, tracking and just some 
            circus activities.
        </p>
